Grelin was a space that tried to foster discussion and dissemination of the latest scientific research relevant to the biohacker community. Although the project is not currently operational, it stands as a testament for my attempt to create such a specialized community platform.

## üß¨ About Grelin
Grelin is a platform that was inspired by the likes of Hackernews, crafted specifically for biohackers and nootropic enthusiasts. It's core values was objectivity, free-speech and science. This project was built using Vue 3, Firebase/Firestore, and Netlify, and it features an automated system that periodically crawls PubMed for the latest studies on nootropics and biohacking, sharing them directly to the main feed if relevant.
